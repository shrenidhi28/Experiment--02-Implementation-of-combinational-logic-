Implementation of combinational logic gates
 
## AIM:
To implement the given logic function verify its operation in Quartus using Verilog programming.
 F1= A’B’C’D’+AC’D’+B’CD’+A’BCD+BC’D
F2=xy’z+x’y’z+w’xy+wx’y+wxy
 
 
 
## Equipments Required:
Hardware – PCs, Cyclone II , USB flasher Software – Quartus prime


## Theory
 

## Logic Diagram

## Procedure
Connect the supply (+5V) to the circuit Switch ON the main switch Press the switches for inputs “A” and “B”. The switch is ON state when 1 is pressed. The switch is OFF state when 0 is pressed. If the output is 1, then the bulb glows. Check all the gates following the same procedure

## Result:
Thus the different digital IC’s are studied and the truth table for different logic gates are verified.
Thus the given logic functions are implemented using  and their operations are verified using Verilog programming.
